Hi, folks. I'm Paul Ducklin. I'm a Principal Research Scientist at Sophos, where I have been active in the cybersecurity scene for many years. 

My job, simply put, is to explain in plain English the sort of technological stuff that often gets lost in jargon. You can find me at https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com, and listen to our podcasts at https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/podcasts.

The `minimalisti-C` repository is here as a convenience for readers who need a tiny, free, unencumbered C compiler that's trivial to install, so they can have a go with the Windows C code that I include in some of my articles. For quick experiments or threat-hunts, the sub-half-megabyte download of `minimalisti-C` makes it a lot more convenient than fetching 10GByte or more's worth of Visual Studio!
