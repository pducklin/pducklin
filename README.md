Hi, folks. I'm Paul Ducklin. I'm a Principal Research Scientist at Sophos, where I have been active in the cybersecurity scene for many years. 

My job, simply put, is to explain in plain English the sort of technological stuff that often gets lost in jargon. You can find me at https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com, listen to our podcasts at https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/podcast and watch my weekly Friday Fun videos at https://facebook.com/SophosSecurity/live.
