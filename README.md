Hi, folks. I'm Paul Ducklin. I've been part of the cybersecurity scene for many years. 

**One of my special skills is explaining in plain English the sort of technical stuff that often gets lost in jargon. Hire me to write, present, do webinars, and host podcasts for you. Hire me because I have many years of real experience in cybersecurity - not just one year's worth many times over.**

You can find my contact details at <https://pducklin.com/about>.

The `minimalisti-C` repository below is a convenience for readers who need a tiny, free, unencumbered C compiler that's trivial to install. Why fetch multigigabytes of Visual Studio or mingw-w64 when you can use this tookit of under half a megabyte!

The `onenetd` repository was originally written by Adam Sampson way back in the early 2000s. It's essentially a tiny one-port replacement for inetd. I have added it here mainly for my own convenience in finding it again, though you may find it useful if you've ever needed to user inetd, ncat, and the like when doing tests, hacks, or experiments.

Note that I use the awesome [Fossil SCM](https://fossil-scm.org/) for my own development needs, rather than git/GitHub, so you won't see much activity here. If you have pull requests, questions, or suggestions, feel free to contact me directly. (See above.)
