Hi, folks. I'm Paul Ducklin. I'm a Principal Research Scientist at Sophos, where I have been active in the cybersecurity scene for many years. 

My job, simply put, is to explain in plain English the sort of technological stuff that often gets lost in jargon. You can find me at https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com, and listen to our podcasts at https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/podcasts.
