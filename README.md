Hi, folks. I'm Paul Ducklin. I've been part of the cybersecurity scene for many years. 

One of my special skills is explaining in plain English the sort of technological stuff that often gets lost in jargon. 

The `minimalisti-C` repository below is a convenience for readers who need a tiny, free, unencumbered C compiler that's trivial to install, so they can have a go with the Windows C code that I include in some of my posts and articles. For quick experiments or threat-hunts, the sub-half-megabyte download of `minimalisti-C` makes it a lot more convenient than fetching 10GByte or more's worth of Visual Studio!
