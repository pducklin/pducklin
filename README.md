Hi, folks. I'm Paul Ducklin, but you probably figured that out from the name of my Github account combined with the text I already put under my picture.

That picture was taken a year or two BC (before coronavirus), so my hair is a bit more impressive Ior perhaps I mean expressive) these days.

I'm a Principal Research Scientist at Sophos, where I have been active in the cybersecurity scene for many years. My job, simply put, is to explain in plain English the sort of technological stuff that often gets lost in jargon. You can find me at https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com, listen to our podcasts at https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/podcast and watch my weekly Friday Fun videos at https://facebook.com/SophosSecurity/live.
